"# My-Collection" 

Work in progress:

People like to "show off" the television shows they've seen, the handpicked anime that they've fallen in love with, the video games they've experienced and the books they've read. The media they've consumed is a representation of who they are.

The concept of this app is to let people show off who they are through the TV shows, animes, video games, and books they've read.
